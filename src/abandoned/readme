This folder contains some modules and scripts that HAVE BEEN USED in history.
For some reasons, I do NOT want to use them any more.
Anyway, that doesnt mean they are useless at all.
So I collect them in this "abandoned" folder.

Here are some reasons why I abanon them:

1 Plu.pm: 
I use Plucene within this module. The problem is slow, EXTREMELY slow. 
I used it because it inherits from Lucene in Java.
Unfortunately, the speed of Lucene did not come along.
It seems forever to index a txt file of, about 30MB, which is unacceptable.
Another reason is that Plucene is so hard to install, it requires lots of moduls, like sands.
This unwelcome attributes may cause problems on other platforms like Windows.
I use KinoSearch instead, it is stable and fast, easy to install as well. (PPM and MCPAN)

2 Split_clean.pm
I use this module to split words for indexing and searching.
The problem happens for the Chinese words.
I want to delete all the Chinese symbols from file names with regexp.
I cannot write them directly into the script file like any other English strings.
As the encoding may change cross different platforms, it will become unreadable.
So I simply convert the Chinese string into hex codes for different platforms.  
And this module can only be used on the platform using UTF-8 as default encoding.
